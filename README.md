### Bank-Customer-Transaction-Analysis

The dataset contains 12043 transactions for 100 customers who have one bank account each. Trasactional period
is from 01/08/2018 - 31/10/2021. The data entries are unique and have consistent formats for
analysis. For each record/row, information is complete for majority of columns. Some columns contain missing
data (blank or NA cells), which is likely due to the nature of transaction. (i.e. merchants are not involved for
InterBank transfers or Salary payments) It is also noticed that there is only 91 unique dates in the dataset,
suggesting the transaction records for one day are missing (turned out to be 2018-08-16).
The range of each feature should also be examined which shows that there is one customer that resides outside
Australia.
